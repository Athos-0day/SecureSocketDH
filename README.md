# SecureSocketDH

This project implements a simple secure communication channel using Diffie-Hellman key exchange over sockets in C.

## Features

- TCP client-server communication
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a shared secret
- Basic protection against Man-in-the-Middle attacks using digital signatures
- Example code for generating and exchanging keys

## Usage

1. Compile the server and client programs. `make`
2. Run the server: `./server`
3. Run the client: `./client`
4. Observe the key exchange and communication logs.
